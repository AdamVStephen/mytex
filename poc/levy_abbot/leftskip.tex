First paragraph has a post paragraph redefinition of 0.25in
\leftskip=0.25in

Next paragraph will inherit the new definition.

Third paragraph will not shift back out to the right if
the post redefinition occurs after a blank line (signals EOP).

\leftskip=1.25in

Final paragraph is pushed 1.25in to the right.
