% Section 6.11 Levy


An example custom parshape demonstration.  Goal is to have two triangular pieces of text that
we merge together with boxes.

\def\leftitem#1{\item{\hbox to\parindent{\enspace#1\hfill}}}

%\newdimen\waspi
%\waspi=parindent

Below this paragraph, we make a right leaning triangle.

%\eightpoint
\parshape=9 0cm 2.0cm%
0cm 2.5cm%
0cm 3.0cm%
0cm 3.5cm%
0cm 4.0cm%
0cm 4.5cm%
0cm 5.0cm%
0cm 5.5cm%
0cm 6.0cm%
This paragraph has some lines to be split across triangular spacing.
