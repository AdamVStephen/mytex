I have recently established a new directory on math.
utah. edu to hold errata files; any book in the bibliography collection is eligible for representation. The
new book on I4m by Jane Hahn [lo], and the new
book by Raymond Seroul and Silvio Levy [18] (both
cited in earlier columns) are covered there, as are
some earlier books about w and IPW. Several of
these errata and comment summaries can be typeset
by I4QX using a style file, erratum.sty, included
in the collection.
You can find these files in 'ftp/pub/tex/
errata with anonymous ftp, or in tex/errata with
the tuglib server.

A good list of other TeX books.
